-- Step 11 - The Trader Strategy

-- Scenario 3: The Trader
-- Nandita is the Queen of crypto trading - she wants to follow the popular trader's adage of BUY LOW, SELL HIGH

-- Nandita's Transaction History
-- * She also starts out with a 50 BTC and ETH purchase just like Leah and Vikram
-- * She continues to buy more crypto over the 4 years
-- * She starts selling some of her crypto portfolio to realise gains

-- Nandita's Data: This final scenario 3 is actually exactly the same as our real trading.transactions dataset!
-- To complete our individual scenarios before we calculate all our metrics for all mentors - let's also prepare another temp table called nandita_trading_strategy

CREATE TABLE nandita_trading_strategy AS
SELECT * FROM trading.transactions
WHERE member_id = 'a87ff6';

SELECT * FROM nandita_trading_strategy LIMIT 10;

-- Final Evaluation Metrics: By the end of our assessment period on the 29th of August 2021 - we can calculate Nandita's metrics as follows for each individual BTC and ETH portfolio:
-- * Count of buy and sell transactions
-- * Total investment amount of purchases
-- * The dollar amount of fees for purchase transactions
-- * Dollar cost average of purchases
-- * Total gross revenue of sell transactions
-- * Average sell price for each unit sold
-- * Final portfolio value and quantity
-- * Profitability measured as (final portfolio value + gross sales revenue - purchase fees - sales fees) / initial investment amount

-- Bonus Question: We also want to calculate the difference if Nandita didn't sell any of her crypto and compare it to the final value at the end of 
-- August - how much does this impact her overall profitability?

-- Question 1: Calculate Nandita's purchase metrics for each of her BTC and ETH portfolios:
-- * Count of purchase transactions
-- * Initial investment
-- * Purchase fees
-- * Dollar cost average of purchases

-- Question 4 & 5 (bonus!)
-- What is Nandita's overall profitability and theoretical profitability if she didn't sell any of her portfolio?
-- We will try to minimise how many times we access the temp table nandita_trading_strategy to optimise our query performance!
