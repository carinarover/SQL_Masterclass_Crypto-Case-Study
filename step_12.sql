-- Step 12 - Final Case Study Questions
-- To finish up our entire cryptocurrency case study - let's now calculate exactly the same query that we just created for Nandita's data with 
-- our entire dataset with all mentors included!

-- Create The Base Table: Create a summary table mentor_performance which includes the following metrics for each member and ticker:
-- * Count of purchase transactions
-- * Initial investment
-- * Purchase fees
-- * Dollar cost average of purchases
-- * Count of sales transactions
-- * Gross revenue amount
-- * Sales fees
-- * Average selling price
-- * Actual Profitability (final portfolio value + gross sales revenue - purchase fees - sales fees) / initial investment amount
-- * Theoretical Profitability (final portfolio value with no sales - purchase fees) / initial investment amount
