Here are some of the topics which you covered in this short but sweet SQL Masterclass course:

#### Step 2: Inspecting the trading.members table

Selecting rows and columns from database tables with SELECT

Use LIMIT to only return a set number of rows from a query

Counting the number of records using COUNT(*)

Counting the number of unique column and table records using `COUNT(DISTINCT)

Filtering data using a WHERE filter

Selecting DATE ranges using BETWEEN, >, >=, <, <=

Using the IN and NOT IN filter conditions to remove and keep records

Use CASE WHEN to apply simple if-else logic to an existing column


#### Step 3: Analyzing daily BTC and ETH prices in the trading.prices table
Finding the MIN and MAX dates
Use GROUP BY to aggregate data at different levels for analysis
Extracting information from dates using DATE_TRUNC and EXTRACT
Using DATE_TRUNC to obtain the begining date of month for a DATE
Using AVG to find the average price
Casting float data types to an exact NUMERIC to use with the ROUND function
Using AND conditions to apply multiple logical rules for WHERE filters
Using SUM CASE WHEN to aggregate logical values similar to a COUNTIF in Excel
Casting INTEGER data types to a NUMERIC to avoid integer floor division errors

#### Step 4: View all transaction histories in the trading.transactions table
More advanced usage of SUM CASE WHEN to replicate SUMIF functionality in Excel
How to filter records from a GROUP BY result using the HAVING clause
Using CTEs and subqueries to perform the same filtering of results
Use a RANK window function to perform custom ordering for a results set

#### Step 5: Starting data analysis
Interpreting entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to visualize table joins
Analyzing ranges of data to make sure the analysis periods are aligned
Perform an INNER JOIN to combine datasets to select columns from both tables
Combining CTEs and joins for step-wise queries
Combining multiple aggregation functions to generate larger table outputs

#### Steps 6-7: Planning ahead and using base tables for data analysis
Drop and create a temporary table to re-use in future SQL queries
Add time INTERVAL to a date
Use ALTER and UPDATE statements to manipulate an existing temporary table
Use a custom WINDOW FRAME clause to specify a sliding window for cumulative metrics
Use a SUM window function to calculate a denominator value for percentage calculations
Use MAX CASE WHEN to pivot data from long to wide

#### Steps 8-12: Final Case Study Scenarios
Creating simplified data scenarios to better understand each question
Implementing a SUM PRODUCT aggregation to calculate initial investments
Performing multiple joins to the same tables with different joining conditions
Multiplying many columns to generate fees based off percentages
Calculating hypothetical scenarios and implementing complex logic using SQL
Creating a complete CTE workflow to generate a reporting dataset
Aggregating data at multiple levels to generate multiple insights
